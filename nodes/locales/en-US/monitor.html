    <p>Secure your smart home with this monitoring node. It monitors signals and triggers the output on unexpected events. A warning time can be configured, before the alarm goes off.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder">Questions or bugs</h3>
        <p>Please contact me, if you have any question. Let me know, if something is not clear or you have found a bug, a typo or something else. I'm happy for any opportunity to improve the solutions, as I use them by myself. <a href="https://github.com/danube/node-red-contrib-smarthome-monitor/issues" target="_blank">Raise an issue on GitHub</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/dDCxcbYnmd" target="_blank">Talk to me in Discord</a>.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder">Configuration</h3>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Name</h4>
        <p>If unset, the node shows "Monitor" on the drawboard. If you give it any value here, the node will be shown with this string.</p>
        
        <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Arming topic</h4>
        <p>A defined message on the node's input arms and disarms the node. The message must contain a defined topic, which you can set here. If this field is left blank, the topic must be "activate". See section "<a href="#armdisarm">Arming and disarming</a>" to learn more.</p>
        
        <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Warning time</h4>
        <p>When armed, the node watches out for a sensor message. If you have configured a warning time bigger than zero, the node will send a warning message first and a timer starts. Once the configured warning time has elapsed, the node will send an alarm message. If you have configured a zero warning time, the node will send an alarm message immediately. The same is valid if you overwrite the warning time with a message.</p>
        <p>In short, that's the time when you open a window but have not disarmed the node until the siren shouts.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Allow msg.timeout to overwrite</h4>
        <p>If this checkbox is active, you can modify the warning time during runtime, without the need of manually re-configuring and re-deploying the node. See "<a href="#ovwrntime">Overwrite warning time</a>" to learn more about the message specification.</p>
        
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Node status</h3>
    <p>The status shows the active warning time together with the functional state. The state can be "Disarmed" with a grey ring, "Armed" with a green dot, "Warning" with a yellow dot or "Alert" with a red dot.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Input messages</h3>

        <h4 id="armdisarm" style="font-weight: bolder;">Arming and disarming</h4>
        <p>As long as the node is disarmed, nothing will happen. Ever. Once armed, the input is monitored and warning and alert messages on the output will be sent, if any message arrives.</p>
        <dl class="message-properties">
            <dt>msg.topic<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
            <dd>If you left "Arming topic" empty, use <code>activate</code> as topic. Otherwise, use the string configured.</dd>
            <dt>msg.payload<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
            <dd><code>true</code> to arm, <code>false</code> to disarm.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h4 id="ovwrntime" style="font-weight: bolder;">Overwrite warning time</h4>
        <p>While the warning time configured in the node settings is static, you can dynamically change this time. You can add this <code>msg.timeout</code> to any message you want, like with the change node to the arming message.</p>
        <dl class="message-properties">
            <dt>msg.timeout<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
            <dd>Value in miliseconds, i.e. <code>15000</code> sets the warning time to 15 seconds.</dd>
        </dl>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Warning and error codes</h3>
    <p>Warnings and errors will be sent both to the integrated Node-RED debugger and the terminal, so it may be a good idea to have focus to at least one of them. If a warning or an error happens, it will be sent to there with a leading identifier. This starts either with "W" for warnings or "E" for errors. Example: "E007: Invalid James Bond detected, replace!". Here's the list of codes supported by this individual node.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Warnings (Wxxx)</h4>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bolder;">W010: Arming payload invalid</h5>
            <p>The node received a message containing the arming topic. Such a message must contain either boolean <code>true</code> to arm or <code>false</code> to disarm. The payload was neither of those, which results in that warning. Make sure that your arming message contains a valid payload.</p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bolder;">Errors (Exxx)</h4>
            <h5 style="font-weight: bolder;">E010: Warning time unit invalid</h5>
            <p>In your node configuration, you have to set a timeout value (or use <code>0</code> to disable) together with a unit (Seconds, Minutes, Hours). As this unit has to be set from a dropdown, there should not be a way the node receives anything else than one of these. Anyways, the unit will be checked and if, for some weird reason, it is not one of those selectable, you will see this error. Get in touch with the developer to get that fixed.</p>
